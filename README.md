# Locom

This file contains the 2 projects, locomServer and Locom. The first contains server code written in java which makes use of sockets and Google's Json library Gson to send and receive messages from an android app 'Locom'. Screenshots of the android app can be seen in the appimages directory.

We were not terribly worried about the app's UI so the layout is all very basic. The user is first presented with a login screen to enter a username and for demo purposes, a location in longitude and latitude (Map to be integrated in later advancements) or the user can just default to the current location. Once logged in the user will see a list of broadcasts received on the home screen and an option to send a broadcast. The app uses a nagivation drawer to load different fragment views. The user can set interest tags such as 'free food' and 'music' so they receive broadcasts that they fall within range of and are interested in. Creating a broadcast is a simple set of inputs name, description, date, time, location (Map to be integrated in later advancements), tags, and radius. A sent broadcast will be sent to the server to be dispatched to the appropriate users who will receive a notification and have that broadcast added to their list on the home screen. From this list a user can click on the name of the broadcast to view a details page including all the relevent information from that broadcast.
